         <h4>TiniHost wants you to have a safe and fun experience meeting locals. Unfortunately, we do not have the infrastructure to screen the mental health of all of our users. So please, use your common sense when meeting strangers. TiniHost highly recommends meeting during daylight hours and in public places, at least for your initial meetup. Don't be afraid to leave or use the appropriate authorities when feeling uncomfortable or threatened by someone. Please contact our team if you ever run into problems with anyone and we'll make sure to investigate and blacklist the host if necessary.</h4>
